# Hello there!

## My Portfolio
My first big project "The Grand Line Anime" was created for anime lovers, it encompasses a lot of functions that myself, as someone who thoroughly enjoys anime, would appreciate. The web application uses APIs to generate the information and other features were also added to enhance user experience. 
The other two projects were built to be simple. The weather dashboard is able to pull a lot of useful information while also maintaining its simplicity for navigation and use. The Code Quiz was a beginning project that only uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

## About Me
My name is Anna Cheng and I am a coding student currently taking online classes. I am an UCR alumni who studied in studio art and my goal for learning coding is to work for a video game company one day. My favorite coding language right now is Javascript because it is both fun and challenging.
